### Virtual Environment Optimization for RunPod Serverless |TASK:TASK-2025-08-06-001|
- **What**: Implemented comprehensive virtual environment optimization for RunPod serverless deployment to achieve <4GB container size target
- **Why**: Original container size was too large for RunPod serverless deployment; needed space optimization through virtual environment on network volume
- **How**: Created multi-stage Docker build with virtual environment on /runpod-volume/higgs, implemented bootstrap_venv.sh script for runtime dependency installation, added comprehensive validation scripts, and created detailed documentation
- **Issues**: Required careful coordination between Docker build process, virtual environment creation, and RunPod network volume integration; needed to ensure all packages work correctly in isolated environment
- **Result**: Successfully implemented virtual environment optimization with estimated 1.5-2GB space savings, comprehensive testing infrastructure, and production-ready deployment documentation

### Container Startup Failure Resolution |TASK:TROUBLESHOOT-CONTAINER-2025-08-06-001|
- **What**: Resolved critical container startup failure causing 'worker exited with exit code 1' in RunPod serverless deployment
- **Why**: Container was failing to start due to premature import attempts during package installation, preventing RunPod serverless deployment
- **How**: Fixed multiple root causes: 1) Created missing __init__.py file in audio_processing directory, 2) Reorganized Dockerfile installation sequence to install all dependencies before package installation, 3) Added dependency verification steps, 4) Implemented lazy loading in main __init__.py to prevent premature imports
- **Issues**: audio_processing directory lacked __init__.py file making it non-importable, package installation (pip install -e . --no-deps) was triggering imports before librosa/soundfile dependencies were available, causing immediate startup failure
- **Result**: Container should now startupsuccessfully with proper dependency sequence and lazy loading, resolving the exit code 1 issue for RunPod serverless deployment

### Docker Build Dependency Conflict Resolution |TASK:TASK-2025-08-05-006|
- **What**: Resolved critical PyTorch dependency conflict in Docker build for RunPod serverless deployment
- **Why**: Docker build was failing due to version mismatch between torch==2.0.1 and torchaudio==2.0.1, preventing successful container creation
- **How**: Updated both Dockerfile.runpod.ultra and requirements.runpod.ultra to use compatible PyTorch 2.6.0 with CUDA 12.6 support, added CUDA version verification logging
- **Issues**: torchaudio 2.0.1 requires torch==2.0.0, but Dockerfile was trying to install torch==2.0.1, causing dependency resolution failure
- **Result**: Docker build will now succeed with compatible PyTorch stack and provide CUDA version verification in build logs

### Code Quality and Deployment Readiness Analysis |TASK:TASK-2025-08-05-005|
- **What**: Conducted comprehensive code quality analysis and deployment readiness assessment for RunPod serverless
- **Why**: Ensure codebase meets quality standards and is ready for production deployment on RunPod platform
- **How**: Ran flake8 style and error checking across all Python files, identified critical and style issues, assessed deployment readiness
- **Issues**: 887 line length violations, 1 critical undefined name error (BaseStreamer), 4 unused imports, 2 variable redefinitions, 4 bare except clauses
- **Result**: Codebase is generally deployment-ready with few critical issues that need immediate attention before production deployment

### Final Commit Preparation and Phase Completion |TASK:TASK-2025-08-05-004|
- **What**: Completed final commit preparation for RunPod serverless deployment clarification and documentation phase
- **Why**: Wrap up the RunPod Optimization and Enhancement phase with all assets committed and pushed to GitHub
- **How**: Updated TASKS.md to mark final task as complete, prepared comprehensive commit with all new assets including GitHub Actions workflow, bootstrap script, documentation, and configuration files
- **Issues**: None encountered - smooth final preparation and commit process
- **Result**: All RunPod optimization and clarification assets ready for final commit and push to GitHub repository

### RunPod Serverless Deployment Clarification |TASK:TASK-2025-08-05-004|
- **What**: Identified and corrected fundamental misunderstandings about RunPod serverless deployment architecture
- **Why**: Original deployment approach was incorrect - RunPod serverless doesn't build containers locally but uses pre-built containers from registry
- **How**: Analyzed existing deployment files, identified key issues, created comprehensive correction with GitHub Actions workflow and bootstrap process
- **Issues**: Several critical misconceptions about RunPod serverless platform, container building process, S3 configuration, and model management
- **Result**: Complete deployment architecture correction with proper GitHub Actions CI/CD, ultra-thin container design, runtime bootstrap process, and comprehensive documentation

### Code Formatting Fixes - Ruff Linter |TASK:TASK-2025-08-05-003|
- **What**: Fixed code formatting issues using ruff linter across the codebase
- **Why**: Ensure code meets style standards and improve readability
- **How**: Used ruff format and ruff check --fix to automatically resolve formatting issues
- **Issues**: Initially 450 formatting issues found, automated fixes resolved 397 issues
- **Result**: Code now meets style standards with only minor style warnings remaining

- **What**: Successfully committed and pushed comprehensive RunPod optimization assets to GitHub
- **Why**: Complete the RunPod serverless deployment package with all optimization tools and configurations
- **How**: Added 10 files including optimized Docker, health monitoring, test scripts, and deployment configs; pushed to sruckh/higgs-audio-v2 repository
- **Issues**: Authentication issues with HTTPS remote resolved by using SSH remote target
- **Result**: Successfully deployed 1,954 lines of optimization code to GitHub repository
