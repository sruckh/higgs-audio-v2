  - Architecture overview with correct workflow
  - Step-by-step GitHub Actions setup
  - Network volume configuration
  - Endpoint deployment instructions
  - Testing examples and API calls
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Performance optimization guidance
- **Length**: Comprehensive guide with detailed examples

- **Purpose**: Template for RunPod serverless endpoint configuration
- **Content**:
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Network volume mounting
  - Timeout settings for bootstrap and inference
  - GPU and container specifications
- **Usage**: Template for users to customize their deployments

### 2. Files Modified

#### `deploy-runpod.sh`
- **Changes**: Added prominent deprecation notice and warnings
- **Purpose**: Clarify that this script is NOT for RunPod serverless
- **Additions**:
  - Warning header about script being for traditional RunPod only
  - References to correct documentation and GitHub Actions
  - Guidance about proper serverless deployment process
- **Reason**: Prevent users from following incorrect deployment approach

### 3. Files Updated in Memory System

#### `TASKS.md`
- **Updates**:
  - Added new task TASK-2025-08-004 for deployment clarification
  - Updated task context with detailed findings and decisions
  - Modified task chain to include new task
  - Updated progress count (4/4 tasks completed)
  - Added new task to completed archive
  - Marked current task as COMPLETE with completion timestamp

#### `JOURNAL.md`
- **Updates**:
  - Added new journal entry for 2025-08-05 05:00
  - Documented the deployment clarification task
  - Captured key findings and architectural corrections
  - Linked to TASK-2025-08-05-004 for context

## Key Findings and Corrections

### 1. Fundamental Misunderstandings Identified
- **Issue**: Original deploy-runpod.sh tried to build containers locally
- **Reality**: RunPod serverless doesn't build containers - it runs pre-built containers from registry
- **Solution**: Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated building

### 2. Container Architecture Issues
- **Issue**: Dockerfile.runpod included too many dependencies
- **Reality**: Serverless containers must be <5GB (preferably <2GB)
- **Solution**: Created Dockerfile.runpod.ultra with minimal base + bootstrap process

### 3. Runtime Process Missing
- **Issue**: No mechanism for runtime dependency installation and model download
- **Reality**: First inference needs to download models to network volume
- **Solution**: Created bootstrap.sh for runtime setup and model management

### 4. S3 Configuration Problems
- **Issue**: S3 credentials being passed as AI call parameters
- **Reality**: Should use environment variables for security
- **Solution**: Configured proper environment variable usage in endpoint config

### 5. Documentation Gap
- **Issue**: No comprehensive guide for correct serverless deployment
- **Solution**: Created complete deployment guide with examples and troubleshooting

## Correct RunPod Serverless Architecture

### Phase 1: Container Building (GitHub Actions)
- Automated builds on code push to main
- Push to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- Uses ultra-thin base container (<2GB)

### Phase 2: Runtime Bootstrap (Container Startup)
- Bootstrap script runs automatically
- Installs additional dependencies
- Prepares network volume structure
- Validates environment and configurations

### Phase 3: First Inference (Model Download)
- First request triggers model download
- Models saved to /runpod-volume/bosonai/
- Higgs AI modules downloaded from HuggingFace

### Phase 4: Subsequent Requests (Fast Response)
- Models cached in memory and on network volume
- Fast processing without download delays
- Optional S3 upload for output storage

## Commit Strategy

### Commit Message Format:
```
fix: Correct RunPod serverless deployment architecture and documentation

- Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated container building
- Create ultra-thin Dockerfile with runtime bootstrap process
- Add comprehensive serverless deployment guide
- Correct S3 configuration to use environment variables
- Mark deploy-runpod.sh as deprecated for serverless deployment
- Update task management and journal with corrections

Resolves critical deployment misconceptions about RunPod serverless platform.
RunPod serverless requires pre-built containers from registry, not local builds.
