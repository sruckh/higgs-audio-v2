# Task Management

## Active Phase
**Phase**: RunPod Optimization and Enhancement
**Started**: 2025-08-05
**Target**: 2025-08-10
**Progress**: 5/5 tasks completed

## Current Task
**Task ID**: TASK-2025-08-05-005
**Title**: Code Quality and Deployment Readiness Analysis
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-08-05 06:00
**Completed**: 2025-08-05 06:15
**Dependencies**: [TASK-2025-08-05-004]

### Task Context
<!-- Critical information needed to resume this task -->
- **Previous Work**: Completed RunPod serverless deployment clarification and documentation (TASK-2025-08-05-004)
- **Key Files**: 
  - All Python files analyzed for syntax, imports, and style compliance
  - Configuration files checked for deployment readiness
  - Docker and deployment files verified for RunPod compatibility
- **Environment**: Development environment with focus on RunPod serverless deployment
- **Next Steps**: Document findings, commit analysis results, prepare for testing phase

### Findings & Decisions
- **FINDING-001**: Codebase has good overall structure with valid Python syntax and imports
- **FINDING-002**: 887 line length violations detected across multiple files (style issue)
- **FINDING-003**: 1 critical undefined name error: BaseStreamer in modeling_higgs_audio.py
- **FINDING-004**: 4 unused imports and 2 variable redefinitions detected
- **FINDING-005**: 4 bare except clauses that should specify exception types
- **DECISION-001**: Address critical issues (BaseStreamer, unused imports) before deployment
- **DECISION-002**: Code is generally ready for RunPod serverless deployment
- **DECISION-003**: Style issues can be addressed incrementally
